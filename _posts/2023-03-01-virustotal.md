Virustotal Mobile checks the applications installed in your Android phone against virustotal (http://www.virustotal.com). It will inform you about malware (virus, trojans, worms) on your phone and allows you to upload any unknown applications to Virustotal. In other words, Virustotal for Android will get your applications scanned by more than 50 antivirus, flagging any undesired content. Please note that virustotal for Android does not provide real-time protection and, so, is no substitute for any antivirus product, just a second opinion regarding your apps. In this new version, in addition to analyzing all installed applications and to upload them if they are not in Virustotal, any file or url can be analyzed either from the application itself or another application. Also it has a statistics section where you can see a count of all scanned files and those infected applications, files or urls that virustotal has detected through your uploaded.
